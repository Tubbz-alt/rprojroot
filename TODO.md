- [x] Adapt tests to testthat 3e
- [x] Ensure that dependency between source files is cycle-free, as in https://github.com/yonicd/foreman/issues/2
- [x] Ensure that source files correspond to test files via `devtools::test_coverage_file()`
- [x] Import rlang where appropriate
- [x] Close open issues
- [x] Deprecate functions that have moved somewhere else
- [x] Avoid `iris`
- [x] Synchronize with own downstream packages
